# PyFlink R1DL

Rank-1 Dictionary Learning in PyFlink. If you like Java or you want something that is probably more stable and doesn't use the incomplete Flink Python API, an implementation is available at [quinngroup/flink-r1dl](https://github.com/quinngroup/flink-r1dl).

Use with [the `new-iterations-with-multiops` branch of GEOFBOT/flink](https://github.com/GEOFBOT/flink/tree/new-iterations-with-multiops) ([some binaries available here](https://github.com/GEOFBOT/flink/releases/tag/iterations-working)) which has the bulk iterations implementation and tweaks needed to run this script.
